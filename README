This is the libsonic Android NDK wrapper.  I, Bill Cox, wrote it in 2011, with
the exception of AndroidAudioDevice.java, which was written by Mario Zechner,
who posted it on his blog at

Mario has given me permission to place this code into the public domain as well.
I place all of the files created for this project into the public domain.
However, the files sonic.c and sonic.h are from the Vinux "sonic" package and
are licensed under GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1. You can freely
use this NDK application with your commercial application, but if you make
changes to sonic.c or sonic.h, those changes must be shared as described in the
